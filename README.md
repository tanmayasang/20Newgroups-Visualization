# 20Newgroups-Visualization
Visualized the 20 Newsgroups dataset and drew inferences using D3.js and Python
  
The visualization has the following capabilities:
Displays a bar chart with the top K words in the document collection
Enables the user to filter the documents based on topic, and display a bar chart with the frequency of the top K words from that topic.
Export the documents from the selected news topic back to python (as a list of strings).
The API should have two functions:
       plot_top_words(documents, K) # plot top K words using D3 and Javascript
       get_exported_documents() # get the exported documents back to python
